<TANSTACK_TABLE_DOCUMENTATION>

Data Guide
Tables start with your data. Your column definitions and rows will depend on the shape of your data. TanStack Table has some TypeScript features that will help you create the rest of your table code with a great type-safe experience. If you set up your data and types correctly, TanStack Table will be able to infer the shape of your data and enforce that your column definitions are made correctly.

TypeScript
TypeScript is NOT required to use the TanStack Table packages... BUT TanStack Table is written and organized in such a way that makes the awesome TypeScript experience that you get feel like it is one of the main selling points of the library. If you are not using TypeScript, you will be missing out on a lot of great autocompletion and type-checking features that will both speed up your development time and reduce the number of bugs in your code.

TypeScript Generics
Having a basic understanding of what TypeScript Generics are and how they work will help you understand this guide better, but it should be easy enough to pick up as you go. The official TypeScript Generics Docs may be helpful for those not yet familiar with TypeScript.

Defining Data Types
data is an array of objects that will be turned into the rows of your table. Each object in the array represents a row of data (under normal circumstances). If you are using TypeScript, we usually define a type for the shape of our data. This type is used as a generic type for all of the other table, column, row, and cell instances. This Generic is usually referred to as TData throughout the rest of the TanStack Table types and APIs.

For example, if we have a table that displays a list of users in an array like this:

json

[
  {
    "firstName": "Tanner",
    "lastName": "Linsley",
    "age": 33,
    "visits": 100,
    "progress": 50,
    "status": "Married"
  },
  {
    "firstName": "Kevin",
    "lastName": "Vandy",
    "age": 27,
    "visits": 200,
    "progress": 100,
    "status": "Single"
  }
]
Then we can define a User (TData) type like this:

ts

//TData
type User = {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  age: number
  visits: number
  progress: number
  status: string
}
We can then define our data array with this type, and then TanStack Table will be able to intelligently infer lots of types for us later on in our columns, rows, cells, etc. This is because the data type is literally defined as the TData generic type. Whatever you pass to the data table option will become the TData type for the rest of the table instance. Just make sure your column definitions use the same TData type as the data type when you define them later.

ts

//note: data needs a "stable" reference in order to prevent infinite re-renders
const data: User[] = []
//or
const [data, setData] = React.useState<User[]>([])
//or
const data = ref<User[]>([]) //vue
//etc...
Deep Keyed Data
If your data is not a nice flat array of objects, that's okay! Once you get around to defining your columns, there are strategies for accessing deeply nested data in your accessors.

If your data looks something like this:

json

[
  {
    "name": {
      "first": "Tanner",
      "last": "Linsley"
    },
    "info": {
      "age": 33,
      "visits": 100,
    }
  },
  {
    "name": {
      "first": "Kevin",
      "last": "Vandy"
    },
    "info": {
      "age": 27,
      "visits": 200,
    }
  }
]
You can define a type like this:

ts

type User = {
  name: {
    first: string
    last: string
  }
  info: {
    age: number
    visits: number
  }
}
And you will be able to access the data in your column definitions with either dot notation in an accessorKey or simply by using an accessorFn.

ts

const columns = [
  {
    header: 'First Name',
    accessorKey: 'name.first',
  },
  {
    header: 'Last Name',
    accessorKey: 'name.last',
  },
  {
    header: 'Age',
    accessorFn: row => row.info.age, 
  },
  //...
]
This is discussed in more detail in the Column Def Guide.

NOTE: The "keys" in your json data can usually be anything, but any periods in the keys will be interpreted as a deep key and will cause errors.

Nested Sub-Row Data
If you are using expanding features, it can be common to have nested sub-rows in your data. This results in a recursive type that is a bit different.

So if your data looks like this:

json

[
  {
    "firstName": "Tanner",
    "lastName": "Linsley",
    "subRows": [
      {
        "firstName": "Kevin",
        "lastName": "Vandy",
      },
      {
        "firstName": "John",
        "lastName": "Doe",
        "subRows": [
          //...
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "firstName": "Jane",
    "lastName": "Doe",
  }
]
You can define a type like this:

ts

type User = {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  subRows?: User[] //does not have to be called "subRows", can be called anything
}
Where subRows is an optional array of User objects. This is discussed in more detail in the Expanding Guide.

Give Data a "Stable" Reference
The data array that you pass to the table instance MUST have a "stable" reference in order to prevent bugs that cause infinite re-renders (especially in React).

This will depend on which framework adapter you are using, but in React, you should often use React.useState, React.useMemo, or similar to ensure that both the data and columns table options have stable references.

tsx

const fallbackData = []

export default function MyComponent() {
  //‚úÖ GOOD: This will not cause an infinite loop of re-renders because `columns` is a stable reference
  const columns = useMemo(() => [
    // ...
  ], []);

  //‚úÖ GOOD: This will not cause an infinite loop of re-renders because `data` is a stable reference
  const [data, setData] = useState(() => [
    // ...
  ]);

  // Columns and data are defined in a stable reference, will not cause infinite loop!
  const table = useReactTable({
    columns,
    data ?? fallbackData, //also good to use a fallback array that is defined outside of the component (stable reference)
  });

  return <table>...</table>;
}
React.useState and React.useMemo are not the only ways to give your data a stable reference. You can also define your data outside of the component or use a 3rd party state management library like Redux, Zustand, or TanStack Query.

The main thing to avoid is defining the data array inside the same scope as the useReactTable call. That will cause the data array to be redefined on every render, which will cause an infinite loop of re-renders.

tsx

export default function MyComponent() {
  //üòµ BAD: This will cause an infinite loop of re-renders because `columns` is redefined as a new array on every render!
  const columns = [
    // ...
  ];

  //üòµ BAD: This will cause an infinite loop of re-renders because `data` is redefined as a new array on every render!
  const data = [
    // ...
  ];

  //‚ùå Columns and data are defined in the same scope as `useReactTable` without a stable reference, will cause infinite loop!
  const table = useReactTable({
    columns,
    data ?? [], //‚ùå Also bad because the fallback array is re-created on every render
  });

  return <table>...</table>;
}
How TanStack Table Transforms Data
Later, in other parts of these docs, you will see how TanStack Table processes the data that you pass to the table and generates the row and cell objects that are used to create the table. The data that you pass to the table is never mutated by TanStack Table, but the actual values in the rows and cells may be transformed by the accessors in your column definitions, or by other features performed by row models like grouping or aggregation.

How Much Data Can TanStack Table Handle?
Believe it or not, TanStack Table was actually built to scale up to handle potentially hundreds of thousands of rows of data in the client. This is obviously not always possible, depending on the size of each column's data and the number of columns. However, the sorting, filtering, pagination, and grouping features are all built with performance in mind for large datasets.

The default mindset of a developer building a data grid is to implement server-side pagination, sorting, and filtering for large datasets. This is still usually a good idea, but a lot of developers underestimate how much data can actually be handled in the client with modern browsers and the right optimizations. If your table will never have more than a few thousand rows, you can probably take advantage of the client-side features in TanStack Table instead of implementing them yourself on the server. Before committing to letting TanStack Table's client-side features handle your large dataset, you should test it with your actual data to see if it performs well enough for your needs, of course.

This is discussed in more detail in the Pagination Guide.

Column Definitions Guide
Note: This guide is about setting up column definitions for your table and NOT about the actual column objects that are generated within the table instance.

Column defs are the single most important part of building a table. They are responsible for:

Building the underlying data model that will be used for everything including sorting, filtering, grouping, etc.
Formatting the data model into what will be displayed in the table
Creating header groups, headers and footers
Creating columns for display-only purposes, eg. action buttons, checkboxes, expanders, sparklines, etc.
Column Def Types
The following "types" of column defs aren't actually TypeScript types, but more so a way to talk about and describe overall categories of column defs:

Accessor Columns
Accessor columns have an underlying data model which means they can be sorted, filtered, grouped, etc.
Display Columns
Display columns do not have a data model which means they cannot be sorted, filtered, etc, but they can be used to display arbitrary content in the table, eg. a row actions button, checkbox, expander, etc.
Grouping Columns
Group columns do not have a data model so they too cannot be sorted, filtered, etc, and are used to group other columns together. It's common to define a header or footer for a column group.
Column Helpers
While column defs are just plain objects at the end of the day, a createColumnHelper function is exposed from the table core which, when called with a row type, returns a utility for creating different column definition types with the highest type-safety possible.

Here's an example of creating and using a column helper:

tsx

// Define your row shape
type Person = {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  age: number
  visits: number
  status: string
  progress: number
}

const columnHelper = createColumnHelper<Person>()

// Make some columns!
const defaultColumns = [
  // Display Column
  columnHelper.display({
    id: 'actions',
    cell: props => <RowActions row={props.row} />,
  }),
  // Grouping Column
  columnHelper.group({
    header: 'Name',
    footer: props => props.column.id,
    columns: [
      // Accessor Column
      columnHelper.accessor('firstName', {
        cell: info => info.getValue(),
        footer: props => props.column.id,
      }),
      // Accessor Column
      columnHelper.accessor(row => row.lastName, {
        id: 'lastName',
        cell: info => info.getValue(),
        header: () => <span>Last Name</span>,
        footer: props => props.column.id,
      }),
    ],
  }),
  // Grouping Column
  columnHelper.group({
    header: 'Info',
    footer: props => props.column.id,
    columns: [
      // Accessor Column
      columnHelper.accessor('age', {
        header: () => 'Age',
        footer: props => props.column.id,
      }),
      // Grouping Column
      columnHelper.group({
        header: 'More Info',
        columns: [
          // Accessor Column
          columnHelper.accessor('visits', {
            header: () => <span>Visits</span>,
            footer: props => props.column.id,
          }),
          // Accessor Column
          columnHelper.accessor('status', {
            header: 'Status',
            footer: props => props.column.id,
          }),
          // Accessor Column
          columnHelper.accessor('progress', {
            header: 'Profile Progress',
            footer: props => props.column.id,
          }),
        ],
      }),
    ],
  }),
]
Creating Accessor Columns
Data columns are unique in that they must be configured to extract primitive values for each item in your data array.

There are 3 ways to do this:

If your items are objects, use an object-key that corresponds to the value you want to extract.
If your items are nested arrays, use an array index that corresponds to the value you want to extract.
Use an accessor function that returns the value you want to extract.
Object Keys
If each of your items is an object with the following shape:

tsx

type Person = {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  age: number
  visits: number
  status: string
  progress: number
}
You could extract the firstName value like so:

tsx


columnHelper.accessor('firstName')

// OR

{
  accessorKey: 'firstName',
}
Deep Keys
If each of your items is an object with the following shape:

tsx

type Person = {
  name: {
    first: string
    last: string
  }
  info: {
    age: number
    visits: number
  }
}
You could extract the first value like so:

tsx

columnHelper.accessor('name.first', {
  id: 'firstName',
})

// OR

{
  accessorKey: 'name.first',
  id: 'firstName',
}
Array Indices
If each of your items is an array with the following shape:

tsx

type Sales = [Date, number]
You could extract the number value like so:

tsx

columnHelper.accessor(1)

// OR

{
  accessorKey: 1,
}
Accessor Functions
If each of your items is an object with the following shape:

tsx

type Person = {
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  age: number
  visits: number
  status: string
  progress: number
}
You could extract a computed full-name value like so:

tsx

columnHelper.accessor(row => `${row.firstName} ${row.lastName}`, {
  id: 'fullName',
})

// OR

{
  id: 'fullName',
  accessorFn: row => `${row.firstName} ${row.lastName}`,
}
üß† Remember, the accessed value is what is used to sort, filter, etc. so you'll want to make sure your accessor function returns a primitive value that can be manipulated in a meaningful way. If you return a non-primitive value like an object or array, you will need the appropriate filter/sort/grouping functions to manipulate them, or even supply your own! üò¨

Unique Column IDs
Columns are uniquely identified with 3 strategies:

If defining an accessor column with an object key or array index, the same will be used to uniquely identify the column.
Any periods (.) in an object key will be replaced by underscores (_).
If defining an accessor column with an accessor function
The columns id property will be used to uniquely identify the column OR
If a primitive string header is supplied, that header string will be used to uniquely identify the column
üß† An easy way to remember: If you define a column with an accessor function, either provide a string header or provide a unique id property.

Column Formatting & Rendering
By default, columns cells will display their data model value as a string. You can override this behavior by providing custom rendering implementations. Each implementation is provided relevant information about the cell, header or footer and returns something your framework adapter can render eg. JSX/Components/strings/etc. This will depend on which adapter you are using.

There are a couple of formatters available to you:

cell: Used for formatting cells.
aggregatedCell: Used for formatting cells when aggregated.
header: Used for formatting headers.
footer: Used for formatting footers.
Cell Formatting
You can provide a custom cell formatter by passing a function to the cell property and using the props.getValue() function to access your cell's value:

tsx

columnHelper.accessor('firstName', {
  cell: props => <span>{props.getValue().toUpperCase()}</span>,
})
Cell formatters are also provided the row and table objects, allowing you to customize the cell formatting beyond just the cell value. The example below provides firstName as the accessor, but also displays a prefixed user ID located on the original row object:

tsx

columnHelper.accessor('firstName', {
  cell: props => (
    <span>{`${props.row.original.id} - ${props.getValue()}`}</span>
  ),
})
Aggregated Cell Formatting
For more info on aggregated cells, see grouping.

Header & Footer Formatting
Headers and footers do not have access to row data, but still use the same concepts for displaying custom content.

Table Instance Guide
TanStack Table is a headless UI library. When we talk about the table or "table instance", we're not talking about a literal <table> element. Instead, we're referring to the core table object that contains the table state and APIs. The table instance is created by calling your adapter's createTable function (e.g. useReactTable, useVueTable, createSolidTable, createSvelteTable, createAngularTable, useQwikTable).

The table instance that is returned from the createTable function (from the framework adapter) is the main object that you will interact with to read and mutate the table state. It is the one place where everything happens in TanStack Table. When you get to the point where you are rendering your UI, you will use APIs from this table instance.

Creating a Table Instance
To create a table instance, 3 options are required: columns, data, and a getCoreRowModel implementation. There are dozens of other table options to configure features and behavior, but these 3 are required.

Defining Data
Define your data as an array of objects with a stable reference. data can come from anywhere like an API response or defined statically in your code, but it must have a stable reference to prevent infinite re-renders. If using TypeScript, the type that you give your data will be used as a TData generic. See the Data Guide for more info.

Defining Columns
Column definitions are covered in detail in the previous section in the Column Def Guide. We'll note here, however, that when you define the type of your columns, you should use the same TData type that you used for your data.

ts

const columns: ColumnDef<User>[] = [] //Pass User type as the generic TData type
//or
const columnHelper = createColumnHelper<User>() //Pass User type as the generic TData type
The column definitions are where we will tell TanStack Table how each column should access and/or transform row data with either an accessorKey or accessorFn. See the Column Def Guide for more info.

Passing in Row Models
This is explained in much more detail in the Row Models Guide, but for now, just import the getCoreRowModel function from TanStack Table and pass it in as a table option. Depending on the features you plan to use, you may need to pass in additional row models later.

ts

import { getCoreRowModel } from '@tanstack/[framework]-table'

const table = createTable({ columns, data, getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel() })
Initializing the Table Instance
With our columns, data, and getCoreRowModel defined, we can now create our basic table instance, along side any other table options that we want to pass in.

ts

//vanilla js
const table = createTable({ columns, data, getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel() })

//angular
this.table = createAngularTable({ columns: this.columns, data: this.data(), getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel() })

//lit
const table = this.tableController.table({ columns, data, getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel() })

//qwik
const table = useQwikTable({ columns, data, getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel() })

//react
const table = useReactTable({ columns, data, getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel() })

//solid
const table = createSolidTable({ columns, get data() { return data() }, getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel() })

//svelte
const table = createSvelteTable({ columns, data, getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel() })

//vue
const table = useVueTable({ columns, data, getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel() })
So what's in the table instance? Let's take a look at what interactions we can have with the table instance.

Table State
The table instance contains all of the table state, which can be accessed via the table.getState() API. Each table feature registers various states in the table state. For example, the row selection feature registers rowSelection state, the pagination feature registers pagination state, etc.

Each feature will also have corresponding state setter APIs and state resetter APIs on the table instance. For example, the row selection feature will have a setRowSelection API and a resetRowSelection.

ts

table.getState().rowSelection //read the row selection state
table.setRowSelection((old) => ({...old})) //set the row selection state
table.resetRowSelection() //reset the row selection state
This is covered in more detail in the Table State Guides

Table APIs
There are dozens of table APIs created by each feature to help you either read or mutate the table state in different ways.

API reference docs for the core table instance and all other feature APIs can be found throughout the API docs.

For example, you can find the core table instance API docs here: Table API

Table Row Models
There is a special set of table instance APIs for reading rows out of the table instance called row models. TanStack Table has advanced features where the rows that are generated may be very different than the array of data that you originally passed in. To learn more about the different row models that you can pass in as a table option, see the Row Models Guide.


ts

import { getCoreRowModel, useReactTable } from '@tanstack/react-table'

function Component() {
  const table = useReactTable({
    data,
    columns,
    getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel(), //row model
  })
}
What is this getCoreRowModel function? And why do you have to import it from TanStack Table only to just pass it back to itself?

Well, the answer is that TanStack Table is a modular library. Not all code for every single feature is included in the createTable functions/hooks by default. You only need to import and include the code that you will need to correctly generate rows based on the features you want to use.

What are Row Models?
Row models run under the hood of TanStack Table to transform your original data in useful ways that are needed for data grid features like filtering, sorting, grouping, expanding, and pagination. The rows that get generated and render on screen won't necessarily be a 1:1 mapping of the original data that you passed to the table. They may be sorted, filtered, paginated, etc.

Import Row Models
You should only import the row models that you need. Here are all of the row models that are available:

ts

//only import the row models you need
import {
  getCoreRowModel,
  getExpandedRowModel,
  getFacetedMinMaxValues,
  getFacetedRowModel,
  getFacetedUniqueValues,
  getFilteredRowModel,
  getGroupedRowModel,
  getPaginationRowModel,
  getSortedRowModel,
}
//...
const table = useReactTable({
  columns,
  data,
  getCoreRowModel: getCoreRowModel(),
  getExpandedRowModel: getExpandedRowModel(),
  getFacetedMinMaxValues: getFacetedMinMaxValues(),
  getFacetedRowModel: getFacetedRowModel(),
  getFacetedUniqueValues: getFacetedUniqueValues(),
  getFilteredRowModel: getFilteredRowModel(),
  getGroupedRowModel: getGroupedRowModel(),
  getPaginationRowModel: getPaginationRowModel(),
  getSortedRowModel: getSortedRowModel(),
})
Customize/Fork Row Models
You don't have to use the exact row models that are provided by TanStack Table. If you need some advanced customization for certain row models, feel free to copy the source code for the row model you want to customize and modify it to your needs.

Using Row Models
Once your table instance has been created, you can access all of the row models that you may need directly from the table instance. There are even more derived row models available apart from the ones that you may have imported.

For normal rendering use cases, you will probably only need to use the table.getRowModel() method, as this row model will use all/any of the other row models depending on which features you have enabled or disabled. All of the other row models are available for you to "dig into" some of the underlying data transformations that are happening in the table.

Available Row Models on Table Instance
getRowModel - This is the main row model that you should use for rendering your table rows markup. It will use all of the other row models to generate the final row model that you will use to render your table rows.

getCoreRowModel - returns a basic row model that is just a 1:1 mapping of the original data passed to the table.

getFilteredRowModel - returns a row model that accounts for column filtering and global filtering.

getPreFilteredRowModel - returns a row model before column filtering and global filtering are applied.

getGroupedRowModel - returns a row model that applies grouping and aggregation to the data and creates sub-rows.

getPreGroupedRowModel - returns a row model before grouping and aggregation are applied.

getSortedRowModel - returns a row model that has had sorting applied to it.

getPreSortedRowModel - returns a row model before sorting is applied (rows are in original order).

getExpandedRowModel - returns a row model that accounts for expanded/hidden sub-rows.

getPreExpandedRowModel - returns a row model that only includes root level rows with no expanded sub-rows included. Still includes sorting.

getPaginationRowModel - returns a row model that only includes the rows that should be displayed on the current page based on the pagination state.

getPrePaginationRowModel - returns a row model without pagination applied (includes all rows).

getSelectedRowModel - returns a row model of all selected rows (but only based on the data that was passed to the table). Runs after getCoreRowModel.

getPreSelectedRowModel - returns a row model before row selection is applied (Just returns getCoreRowModel).

getGroupedSelectedRowModel - returns a row model of selected rows after grouping. Runs after getSortedRowModel, which runs after getGroupedRowModel, which runs after getFilteredRowModel.

getFilteredSelectedRowModel - returns a row model of selected rows after column filtering and global filtering. Runs after getFilteredRowModel.

The Order of Row Model Execution
Knowing how TanStack Table processes rows internally can help you gain a better understanding of what is happening under the hood, and help you debug any issues you may encounter.

Internally, this is the order in which each of the row models are applied to the data, if their respective features are enabled:

getCoreRowModel -> getFilteredRowModel -> getGroupedRowModel -> getSortedRowModel -> getExpandedRowModel -> getPaginationRowModel -> getRowModel

If in any case the respective feature is disabled or turned off with a "manual*" table option, the getPre*RowModel will be used instead in that step of the process.

As you can see above, first the data is filtered, then grouped, then sorted, then expanded, and then finally paginated as the final step.

Row Model Data Structure
Each row model will provide you the rows in 3 different useful formats:

rows - An array of rows.
flatRows - An array of rows, but all sub-rows are flattened into the top level.
rowsById - An object of rows, where each row is keyed by its id. This is useful for quickly looking up rows by their id with better performance.
ts

console.log(table.getRowModel().rows) // array of rows
console.log(table.getRowModel().flatRows) // array of rows, but all sub-rows are flattened into the top level
console.log(table.getRowModel().rowsById['row-id']) // object of rows, where each row is keyed by its `id`

Rows Guide
This quick guide will discuss the different ways you can retrieve and interact with row objects in TanStack Table.

Where to Get Rows From
There are multiple table instance APIs you can use to retrieve rows from the table instance.

table.getRow
If you need to access a specific row by its id, you can use the table.getRow table instance API.

js

const row = table.getRow(rowId)
Row Models
The table instance generates row objects and stores them in useful arrays called "Row Models". This is discussed in much more detail in the Row Models Guide, but here are the most common ways you may access the row models.

Render Rows
jsx

<tbody>
  {table.getRowModel().rows.map(row => (
    <tr key={row.id}>
     {/* ... */}
    </tr>
  ))}
</tbody>
Get Selected Rows
js

const selectedRows = table.getSelectedRowModel().rows
Row Objects
Every row object contains row data and many APIs to either interact with the table state or extract cells from the row based on the state of the table.

Row IDs
Every row object has an id property that makes it unique within the table instance. By default the row.id is the same as the row.index that is created in the row model. However, it can be useful to override each row's id with a unique identifier from the row's data. You can use the getRowId table option to do this.

js

const table = useReactTable({
  columns,
  data,
  getRowId: originalRow => originalRow.uuid, //override the row.id with the uuid from the original row's data
})
Note: In some features like grouping and expanding, the row.id will have additional string appended to it.

Access Row Values
The recommended way to access data values from a row is to use either the row.getValue or row.renderValue APIs. Using either of these APIs will cache the results of the accessor functions and keep rendering efficient. The only difference between the two is that row.renderValue will return either the value or the renderFallbackValue if the value is undefined, whereas row.getValue will return the value or undefined if the value is undefined.

js

// Access data from any of the columns
const firstName = row.getValue('firstName') // read the row value from the firstName column
const renderedLastName = row.renderValue('lastName') // render the value from the lastName column
Note: cell.getValue and cell.renderValue are shortcuts for the row.getValue and row.renderValue APIs, respectively.

Access Original Row Data
For every row object, you can access the original corresponding data that was passed to the table instance via the row.original property. None of the data in the row.original will have been modified by the accessors in your column definitions, so if you were doing any sort of data transformations in your accessors, those will not be reflected in the row.original object.

js

// Access any data from the original row
const firstName = row.original.firstName // { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe' }
Sub Rows
If you are using either grouping or expanding features, your rows may contain sub-rows or parent row references. This is discussed in much more detail in the Expanding Guide, but here is a quick overview of useful properties and methods for working with sub-rows.

row.subRows: An array of sub-rows for the row.
row.depth: The depth of the row (if nested or grouped) relative to the root row array. 0 for root level rows, 1 for child rows, 2 for grandchild rows, etc.
row.parentId: The unique ID of the parent row for the row (The row that contains this row in its subRows array).
row.getParentRow: Returns the parent row for the row, if it exists.
More Row APIs
Depending on the features that you are using for your table, there are dozens more useful APIs for interacting with rows. See each features' respective API docs or guide for more information.

Cells Guide
This quick guide will discuss the different ways you can retrieve and interact with cell objects in TanStack Table.

Where to Get Cells From
Cells come from Rows. Enough said, right?

There are multiple row instance APIs you can use to retrieve the appropriate cells from a row depending on which features you are using. Most commonly, you will use the row.getAllCells or row.getVisibleCells APIs (if you are using column visibility features), but there are a handful of other similar APIs that you can use.

Cell Objects
Every cell object can be associated with a <td> or similar cell element in your UI. There are a few properties and methods on cell objects that you can use to interact with the table state and extract cell values from the table based on the state of the table.

Cell IDs
Every cell object has an id property that makes it unique within the table instance. Each cell.id is constructed simply as a union of its parent row and column IDs separated by an underscore.

js

{ id: `${row.id}_${column.id}` }
During grouping or aggregation features, the cell.id will have additional string appended to it.

Cell Parent Objects
Every cell stores a reference to its parent row and column objects.

Access Cell Values
The recommended way to access data values from a cell is to use either the cell.getValue or cell.renderValue APIs. Using either of these APIs will cache the results of the accessor functions and keep rendering efficient. The only difference between the two is that cell.renderValue will return either the value or the renderFallbackValue if the value is undefined, whereas cell.getValue will return the value or undefined if the value is undefined.

Note: The cell.getValue and cell.renderValue APIs are shortcuts row.getValue and row.renderValue APIs, respectively.

js

// Access data from any of the columns
const firstName = cell.getValue('firstName') // read the cell value from the firstName column
const renderedLastName = cell.renderValue('lastName') // render the value from the lastName column
Access Other Row Data from Any Cell
Since every cell object is associated with its parent row, you can access any data from the original row that you are using in your table using cell.row.original.

js

// Even if we are in the scope of a different cell, we can still access the original row data
const firstName = cell.row.original.firstName // { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe' }
More Cell APIs
Depending on the features that you are using for your table, there are dozens more useful APIs for interacting with cells. See each features' respective API docs or guide for more information.

Cell Rendering
You can just use the cell.renderValue or cell.getValue APIs to render the cells of your table. However, these APIs will only spit out the raw cell values (from accessor functions). If you are using the cell: () => JSX column definition options, you will want to use the flexRender API utility from your adapter.

Using the flexRender API will allow the cell to be rendered correctly with any extra markup or JSX and it will call the callback function with the correct parameters.

jsx

import { flexRender } from '@tanstack/react-table'

const columns = [
  {
    accessorKey: 'fullName',
    cell: ({ cell, row }) => {
      return <div><strong>{row.original.firstName}</strong> {row.original.lastName}</div>
    }
    //...
  }
]
//...
<tr>
  {row.getVisibleCells().map(cell => {
    return <td key={cell.id}>{flexRender(cell.column.columnDef.cell, cell.getContext())}</td>
  })}
</tr>

Header Groups Guide
This quick guide will discuss the different ways you can retrieve and interact with header group objects in TanStack Table.

What are Header Groups?
Header Groups are simply "rows" of headers. Don't let the name confuse you, it's just that simple. The large majority of tables will only have one row of headers (a single header group), but if you define your column structure with nested columns as with the Column Groups example, you can have multiple rows of headers (multiple header groups).

Where to Get Header Groups From
There are multiple table instance APIs you can use to retrieve header groups from the table instance. table.getHeaderGroups is the most common API to use, but depending on the features that you are using, you may need to use other APIs, such as table.get[Left/Center/Right]HeaderGroups if you are using column pinning features.

Header Group Objects
Header Group objects are similar to Row objects, though simpler since there is not as much going on in header rows as there are in the body rows.

By default, header groups only have three properties:

id: The unique identifier for the header group that is generated from its depth (index). This is useful as a key for React components.
depth: The depth of the header group, zero-indexed based. Think of this as the row index amongst all header rows.
headers: An array of Header cell objects that belong to this header group (row).
Access Header Cells
To render the header cells in a header group, you just map over the headers array from the header group object.

jsx

<thead>
  {table.getHeaderGroups().map(headerGroup => {
    return (
      <tr key={headerGroup.id}>
        {headerGroup.headers.map(header => ( // map over the headerGroup headers array
          <th key={header.id} colSpan={header.colSpan}>
            {/* */}
          </th>
        ))}
      </tr>
    )
  })}
</thead>


Headers Guide
This quick guide will discuss the different ways you can retrieve and interact with header objects in TanStack Table.

Headers are the equivalent of cells, but meant for the <thead> section of the table instead of the <tbody> section.

Where to Get Headers From
Headers come from Header Groups, which are the equivalent of rows, but meant for the <thead> section of the table instead of the <tbody> section.

HeaderGroup Headers
If you are in a header group, the headers are stored as an array in the headerGroup.headers property. Usually you will just map over this array to render your headers.

jsx

<thead>
  {table.getHeaderGroups().map(headerGroup => {
    return (
      <tr key={headerGroup.id}>
        {headerGroup.headers.map(header => ( // map over the headerGroup headers array
          <th key={header.id} colSpan={header.colSpan}>
            {/* */}
          </th>
        ))}
      </tr>
    )
  })}
</thead>
Header Table Instance APIs
There are multiple table instance APIs that you can use to retrieve a list of headers depending on the features that you are using. The most common API you might use is table.getFlatHeaders, which will return a flat list of all headers in the table, but there are at least a dozen other headers that are useful in tandem with the column visibility and column pinning features. APIs like table.getLeftLeafHeaders or table.getRightFlatHeaders could be useful depending on your use case.

Header Objects
Header objects are similar to Cell objects, but meant for the <thead> section of the table instead of the <tbody> section. Every header object can be associated with a <th> or similar cell element in your UI. There are a few properties and methods on header objects that you can use to interact with the table state and extract cell values from the table based on the state of the table.

Header IDs
Every header object has an id property that makes it unique within the table instance. Usually you only need this id as a unique identifier for React keys or if you are following the performant column resizing example.

For simple headers with no advanced nested or grouped headers logic, the header.id will be the same as it's parent column.id. However, if the header is part group column or a placeholder cell, it will have a more complicated id that is constructed from the header family, depth/header row index, column id, and header group id.

Nested Grouped Headers Properties
There are a few properties on header objects that are only useful if the header is part of a nested or grouped header structure. These properties include:

colspan: The number of columns that the header should span. This is useful for rendering the colSpan attribute on the <th> element.
rowSpan: The number of rows that the header should span. This is useful for rendering the rowSpan attribute on the <th> element. (Currently not implemented in default TanStack Table)
depth: The header group "row index" that the header group belongs to.
isPlaceholder: A boolean flag that is true if the header is a placeholder header. Placeholder headers are used to fill in the gaps when a column is hidden or when a column is part of a group column.
placeholderId: The unique identifier for the placeholder header.
subHeaders: The array of sub/child headers that belong to this header. Will be empty if the header is a leaf header.
Note: header.index refers to its index within the header group (row of headers), i.e. its position from left to right. It is not the same as header.depth, which refers to the header group "row index".

Header Parent Objects
Every header stores a reference to its parent column object and its parent header group object.

More Header APIs
Headers have a few more useful APIs attached to them that are useful for interacting with the table state. Most of them relate to the Column sizing and resizing features. See the Column Resizing Guide for more information.

Header Rendering
Since the header column option you defined can be either a string, jsx, or a function returning either of those, the best way to render the headers is to use the flexRender utility from your adapter, which will handle all of those cases for you.

jsx

{headerGroup.headers.map(header => (
  <th key={header.id} colSpan={header.colSpan}>
    {/* Handles all possible header column def scenarios for `header` */}
    {flexRender(header.column.columnDef.header, header.getContext())}
  </th>
))}

Columns Guide
Note: This guide is about the actual column objects that are generated within the table instance and NOT about setting up the column definitions for your table.

This quick guide will discuss the different ways you can retrieve and interact with column objects in TanStack Table.

Where to Get Columns From
You can find the column objects in many places. They are often attached

Header and Cell Objects
Before you reach for one of the table instance APIs, consider if you actually need to retrieve either headers or cells instead of columns. If you are rending out the markup for your table, you will most likely want to reach for the APIs that return headers or cells instead of columns. The column objects themselves are not really meant to render out the headers or cells, but the header and cell objects will contain references to these column objects from which they can derive the necessary information to render their UI.

js

const column = cell.column; // get column from cell
const column = header.column; // get column from header
Column Table Instance APIs
There are dozens of table instance APIs you can use to retrieve columns from the table instance. Which APIs you will use will depend entirely on which features you are using in your table and your use-case.

Get Column
If you need to just get a single column by its ID, you can use the table.getColumn API.

js

const column = table.getColumn('firstName');
Get Columns
The simplest column API is table.getAllColumns, which will return a list of all columns in the table. There are dozens of other column APIs that are affected by other features and the state of the table that come alongside this API though. table.getAllFlatColumns, table.getAllLeafColumns, getCenterLeafColumns, table.getLeftVisibleLeafColumns are just some examples of other column APIs that you might use in tandem with the column visibility or column pinning features.

Column Objects
Column objects are not actually meant to be used to render out the table UI directly, so they are not associated 1-to-1 with any <th> or <td> elements in your table, but they contain a lot of useful properties and methods that you can use to interact with the table state.

Column IDs
Every column must have a unique id defined in their associated Column Definition. Usually, you define this id yourself, or it is derived from the accessorKey or header properties in the column definition.

ColumnDef
A reference to the original columnDef object that was used to created the column is always available on the column object.

Nested Grouped Columns Properties
There are a few properties on column objects that are only useful if the column is part of a nested or grouped column structure. These properties include:

columns: An array of child columns that belong to a group column.
depth: The header group "row index" that the column group belongs to.
parent: The parent column of the column. If the column is a top-level column, this will be undefined.
More Column APIs
There are dozens of Column APIs that you can use to interact with the table state and extract cell values from the table based on the state of the table. See each features column API documentation for more information.

Column Rendering
Don't necessarily use column objects to render headers or cells directly. Instead, use the header and cell objects, as discussed above.

But if you are just rendering a list of columns somewhere else in your UI for something like a column visibility menu or something similar, you can just map over a columns array and render out the UI as you normally would.

Table State (React) Guide
TanStack Table has a simple underlying internal state management system to store and manage the state of the table. It also lets you selectively pull out any state that you need to manage in your own state management. This guide will walk you through the different ways in which you can interact with and manage the state of the table.

Accessing Table State
You do not need to set up anything special in order for the table state to work. If you pass nothing into either state, initialState, or any of the on[State]Change table options, the table will manage its own state internally. You can access any part of this internal state by using the table.getState() table instance API.

jsx

const table = useReactTable({
  columns,
  data,
  //...
})

console.log(table.getState()) //access the entire internal state
console.log(table.getState().rowSelection) //access just the row selection state
Custom Initial State
If all you need to do for certain states is customize their initial default values, you still do not need to manage any of the state yourself. You can simply set values in the initialState option of the table instance.

jsx

const table = useReactTable({
  columns,
  data,
  initialState: {
    columnOrder: ['age', 'firstName', 'lastName'], //customize the initial column order
    columnVisibility: {
      id: false //hide the id column by default
    },
    expanded: true, //expand all rows by default
    sorting: [
      {
        id: 'age',
        desc: true //sort by age in descending order by default
      }
    ]
  },
  //...
})
Note: Only specify each particular state in either initialState or state, but not both. If you pass in a particular state value to both initialState and state, the initialized state in state will take overwrite any corresponding value in initialState.

Controlled State
If you need easy access to the table state in other areas of your application, TanStack Table makes it easy to control and manage any or all of the table state in your own state management system. You can do this by passing in your own state and state management functions to the state and on[State]Change table options.

Individual Controlled State
You can control just the state that you need easy access to. You do NOT have to control all of the table state if you do not need to. It is recommended to only control the state that you need on a case-by-case basis.

In order to control a particular state, you need to both pass in the corresponding state value and the on[State]Change function to the table instance.

Let's take filtering, sorting, and pagination as an example in a "manual" server-side data fetching scenario. You can store the filtering, sorting, and pagination state in your own state management, but leave out any other state like column order, column visibility, etc. if your API does not care about those values.

jsx

const [columnFilters, setColumnFilters] = React.useState([]) //no default filters
const [sorting, setSorting] = React.useState([{
  id: 'age',
  desc: true, //sort by age in descending order by default
}]) 
const [pagination, setPagination] = React.useState({ pageIndex: 0, pageSize: 15 })

//Use our controlled state values to fetch data
const tableQuery = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['users', columnFilters, sorting, pagination],
  queryFn: () => fetchUsers(columnFilters, sorting, pagination),
  //...
})

const table = useReactTable({
  columns,
  data: tableQuery.data,
  //...
  state: {
    columnFilters, //pass controlled state back to the table (overrides internal state)
    sorting,
    pagination
  },
  onColumnFiltersChange: setColumnFilters, //hoist columnFilters state into our own state management
  onSortingChange: setSorting,
  onPaginationChange: setPagination,
})
//...
Fully Controlled State
Alternatively, you can control the entire table state with the onStateChange table option. It will hoist out the entire table state into your own state management system. Be careful with this approach, as you might find that raising some frequently changing state values up a react tree, like columnSizingInfo state`, might cause bad performance issues.

A couple of more tricks may be needed to make this work. If you use the onStateChange table option, the initial values of the state must be populated with all of the relevant state values for all of the features that you want to use. You can either manually type out all of the initial state values, or use the table.setOptions API in a special way as shown below.

jsx

//create a table instance with default state values
const table = useReactTable({
  columns,
  data,
  //... Note: `state` values are NOT passed in yet
})


const [state, setState] = React.useState({
  ...table.initialState, //populate the initial state with all of the default state values from the table instance
  pagination: {
    pageIndex: 0,
    pageSize: 15 //optionally customize the initial pagination state.
  }
})

//Use the table.setOptions API to merge our fully controlled state onto the table instance
table.setOptions(prev => ({
  ...prev, //preserve any other options that we have set up above
  state, //our fully controlled state overrides the internal state
  onStateChange: setState //any state changes will be pushed up to our own state management
}))
On State Change Callbacks
So far, we have seen the on[State]Change and onStateChange table options work to "hoist" the table state changes into our own state management. However, there are a few things about using these options that you should be aware of.

1. State Change Callbacks MUST have their corresponding state value in the state option.
Specifying an on[State]Change callback tells the table instance that this will be a controlled state. If you do not specify the corresponding state value, that state will be "frozen" with its initial value.

jsx

const [sorting, setSorting] = React.useState([])
//...
const table = useReactTable({
  columns,
  data,
  //...
  state: {
    sorting, //required because we are using `onSortingChange`
  },
  onSortingChange: setSorting, //makes the `state.sorting` controlled
})
2. Updaters can either be raw values or callback functions.
The on[State]Change and onStateChange callbacks work exactly like the setState functions in React. The updater values can either be a new state value or a callback function that takes the previous state value and returns the new state value.

What implications does this have? It means that if you want to add in some extra logic in any of the on[State]Change callbacks, you can do so, but you need to check whether or not the new incoming updater value is a function or value.

jsx

const [sorting, setSorting] = React.useState([])
const [pagination, setPagination] = React.useState({ pageIndex: 0, pageSize: 10 })

const table = useReactTable({
  columns,
  data,
  //...
  state: {
    pagination,
    sorting,
  }
  //syntax 1
  onPaginationChange: (updater) => {
    setPagination(old => {
      const newPaginationValue = updater instanceof Function ? updater(old) : updater
      //do something with the new pagination value
      //...
      return newPaginationValue
    })
  },
  //syntax 2
  onSortingChange: (updater) => {
    const newSortingValue = updater instanceof Function ? updater(sorting) : updater
    //do something with the new sorting value
    //...
    setSorting(updater) //normal state update
  }
})
State Types
All complex states in TanStack Table have their own TypeScript types that you can import and use. This can be handy for ensuring that you are using the correct data structures and properties for the state values that you are controlling.

tsx

import { useReactTable, type SortingState } from '@tanstack/react-table'
//...
const [sorting, setSorting] = React.useState<SortingState[]>([
  {
    id: 'age', //you should get autocomplete for the `id` and `desc` properties
    desc: true,
  }
