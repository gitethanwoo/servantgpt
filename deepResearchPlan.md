here's the plan:

1. Overview
   - Instead of handling deep research with multiple external tools and complex orchestration outside the web-search tool, we will embed a generateText call directly in the web-search tool.
   - This call will act as a research agent, tasked with generating a comprehensive research plan, formulating search queries, and reasoning through various sources.

2. Implementation Steps
   a. Modify the webSearch tool:
      - Add logic to detect when a deep research query is desired (e.g., based on a flag or the complexity of the query).
      - When deep research is triggered, create a generateText call inside the webSearch execution path.

   b. Design the prompt for the research agent:
      - The system prompt should instruct the model as follows:
          "You're a research agent tasked with building a research plan. Your job is to generate search queries, plan the order of searches, and reason through various sources to build a comprehensive answer. Provide clear research steps and rationales." 
      - Include details on how to structure the output (e.g., bullet points or numbered steps) and indicate where further search or extraction might be needed.

   c. Handling the Research Plan
      - Parse the returned research plan to extract individual steps or search queries.
      - Optionally, store the full research plan in a log for auditing or debugging.
      - Return the research plan as part of the final result from the webSearch tool.

   d. Fallbacks and Error-Handling
      - Implement error handling in case the generateText call fails or returns an unexpected format.
      - Ensure that the tool still returns a valid result (even if minimal) so that the UI can display fallback information.

3. Future Considerations
   - Iterative deepening: Based on the research plan, additional generateText calls can be chained for extraction, reasoning, and synthesis.
   - Modularizing the research agent logic into its own helper function for clarity and reusability.
   - Integration with citation formatting if the deep research plan references sources.

4. Summary
   - Embed a generateText call inside the webSearch tool to directly generate a research plan as one integrated process.
   - This streamlined approach will reduce external orchestration complexity, and the plan in this file outlines the steps to implement and eventually expand upon this deep research functionality.
